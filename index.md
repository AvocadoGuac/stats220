# My Take On The Winnie The Pooh Meme

## About It
The meme above was my take on the Tuxedo Winnie the Pooh meme which I adapted to relate it to the different stages of stats.

**Personally** I believe that stage 1 stats was...
* Boring
* Slow
* Simple

Although if I did have to rank the stats papers I have taken so far *(or taking)* it would look a bit like...
1. Stats 210
2. Stats 208
3. Stats 330
4. Stats 220
5. Stats 125
6. Stats 108
``` {r}

```
