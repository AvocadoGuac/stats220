# My Take On The Winnie The Pooh Meme

## About It
The meme above was my take on the [Tuxedo Winnie the Pooh meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tuxedo-winnie-the-pooh) which I adapted to relate it to the different stages of stats.

### Some Justification Behind The Stage 1 Libel:

**Personally** I believe that stage 1 stats was...
* Boring
* Slow
* Simple

Nothing against stage 1 stats papers since they are usually an introduction which is later used as a foundation to be built upon, but to be quite honest I just didn't enjoy them that much as apposed to the later stage stats papers.

If I did have to rank the stats papers I have taken so far *(or taking)* it would look a bit like...
1. Stats 210
2. Stats 208
3. Stats 330
4. Stats 220
5. Stats 125
6. Stats 108
